# JTag
------------------------------

## What is JTag

JTag is simple API for reading & writing Named Binary Tag (NBT) based on JNBT.

## How to use it

JTag provides several classes and APIs for that purposes.
Highly recommended to use [NBTInputStream](https://github.com/Vechktor/JTag/) for reading
and [NBTOutputStream](https://github.com/Vechktor/JTag/)

```java
NBTInputStream stream = new NBTInputStream(/** some data here... */);
/**
 * read from stream some data
 */
stream.close();
```
And
```java
NBTOutputStream stream = new NBTOutputStream(/** some data here... */);
/**
 * write to stream some data
 */
stream.close();
```

## Tags

Currently, library supports every modern type of tag. Tags implemented
using type inference and diamond operator. So, you do not need to use
lot of instances and types!

Simply define tag of Integer type. (Library doesn't support primitives!).
```java
// This will create tag with name "my_shiny_tags_name" and value of 10
ITag<Integer> intTag = new ITag<Integer>("my_shiny_tags_name", 10);
```

To get preferred supported type of tag, you can use utility & constants.
This example shows you, how to get Integer type.
```java
NBTUtil.getTypeById(NBTConst.getTypeInt());
```

If needed, you can resolve type of ITag (and other objects) with
utility named GenericTypeResolver. Example below shows, how to
use it.

```java
// Utility name     Method  tag  field    index
GenericTypeResolver.resolve(tag, "value", 0);
```

Tag - is your tag object

Field - is name of field with type, you want to resolve

Index - is index of type (HashMap<K,V>)
